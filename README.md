# MyBooksCatalog
![Appscreen](app.screen.png)
This app is a simple book catalog where you can create books list you want to read. After you add some books you have options to:
- delete them or whole the list,
- edit them,
- add new categories,
- print/save a list,
- sort / filter,
- see quantity of each category.<br>
 I created it using technologies such as like HTML5, CSS, SASS, Vanilla Javascript, webpack.
 Data saves in local storage. On the first opening, the list fills on book samples.
